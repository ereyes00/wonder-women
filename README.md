# wonder-women

With our app, we hope to provide a resource to users who are searching for art-related activities in particular areas. The app will have several components: calendar featuring gallery openings (great way to know where there’s free wine and bites), listings of exhibitions at museums, local galleries and art schools, as well as an up-to-date look at what art films are showing at IFC or Angelika (among others). <br/>
We hope to utilize APIs from museums and scrape a lot of data from the bigger galleries. For smaller galleries, our team sees it as a crowdsourcing opportunity. Users have the option to bookmark events and showings they’re interested in, which will then populate the user’s account calendar.  <br/>
For the more spontaneous users, who happen to be in a specific neighborhood, they utilize the site to plan their day through geolocating. <br/>

To Run: <br/>
Clone the repo <br/>
  `git clone https://github.com/ereyes00/wonder-women.git` <br/>

Install relevant packages <br/>
  `npm install` <br/>

Add a config folder and a config.json file and copy this into it: <br/>
  `{` <br/>
  `"development": {` <br/>
    `"username": "root",` <br/>
    `"password": null,` <br/>
    `"database": "art-gal",` <br/>
    `"host": "127.0.0.1",` <br/>
    `"dialect": "postgres"` <br/>
  `},` <br/>
  `"test": {` <br/>
    `"username": "root",` <br/>
    `"password": null,` <br/>
    `"database": "database_test",` <br/>
    `"host": "127.0.0.1",` <br/>
    `"dialect": "postgres"` <br/>
  `},` <br/>
  `"production": { `<br/>
    `"username": "root",` <br/>
    `"password": null,` <br/>
    `"database": "database_production",` <br/>
    `"host": "127.0.0.1",` <br/>
    `"dialect": "postgres"` <br/>
  `}` <br/>
  `}` <br/>
Make sure you make a database called 'art-gal' in Postgres, edit the 'username' field to the username registered on your computer. <br/>

Run Postgres on your computer and connect through Postico. <br/>

In your terminal run the command: <br/>
  `npm start` <br/>

Open a browser tab to and navigate to  'localhost:3000' <br/>


To run the seed files: <br/>
  In the terminal navigate into the seeders directory. <br/>
  Type: <br/>
    `node <file name>` <br/>
  for each seed file you want to run, in the corresponding order. <br/>
